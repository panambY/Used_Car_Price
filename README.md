# Used_Car_Price
Predict the car price in used vehicles listings from Craigslist.org

## Context
Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

## Content
This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories. For ML projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as long/lat. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset.

This is a Kaggle dataset which can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

I followed in this project the steps of the project management method called CRISP-DM. This method has undergone modifications aimed at the reality of a Data Science project and with that it was called CRISP-DS.
